We can change the Fees, and/or introduce new pricing packages and terms, at any time by giving you 30 days‚Äô prior notice (by email to your Primary Admin or by displaying a message the next time you use the Corals). The new Fees or pricing/package terms will apply to you from expiry of that notice, unless you choose to cancel your account before the changes take effect. Also, the new Fees will apply to you immediately if you choose to change your plan/package (or if you reactivate your plan after cancellation). Fees are charged in advance on a monthly or annual basis and are non-refundable, including if you only use part of a month or year‚Äôs subscription for the Corals Services unless an exclusive payment contract is signed between the merchant and Corals. Unless required by law, we will not provide refunds in connection with the Corals Services.

You indemnify and hold Corals harmless against any claims by any tax authority for any underpayment of any sales, use, goods and services, value added or other tax or levy, and any penalties and/or interest. If you are required to withhold or deduct tax from the Fees, you will pay Corals such additional amounts as are necessary to ensure receipt of the full amount which would have been received but for the deduction.
</span></p>
<p><span class="tb">If you are located outside of Singapore, then payment of your Fees could incur additional bank fees at the discretion of your bank. Bank fees may be charged for currency conversion and international settlement; and your charge may still be subject to additional fees even if you are being charged by Corals in your local currency. If your credit card statement charge differs from your Corals invoice, please contact your bank in the first instance. Corals is not liable for any additional bank transaction fees that may be charged.
